If there is ip or dns issue while connecting to mongodb atals 

ipconfig /all
 This ipconfig /all output provides all the information we need.

You are currently connected via "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi", and your relevant details are:

IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.5
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (which means a Subnet prefix length of 24)
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1
Your current DNS Servers: 192.168.1.1 (this is what we're changing)
Now, go back to that "Edit IP settings" window in your Windows Settings that you previously showed me.

Here's exactly what to type into each field:

Make sure the "IPv4" dropdown is set to "Manual."

Ensure the "IPv4" toggle switch is "On."
In the "IP address" field, type: 192.168.1.5
In the "Subnet prefix length" field, type: 24
In the "Gateway" field, type: 192.168.1.1
In the "Preferred DNS" field, type: 8.8.8.8
In the "Alternate DNS" field, type: 8.8.4.4
Make sure "IPv6" is set to "Off."
Click "Save."

VERY IMPORTANT FINAL STEP:
RESTART YOUR ENTIRE COMPUTER. 
This is absolutely crucial for the new DNS settings to take full effect across your system.
